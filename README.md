# Hi, I'm LÃ­via ðŸ¤“

I'm a software developer focused on multiplatform aplications. Most of my experience is with Java and the Spring ecosystem, but I don't like to stick to a completly closed stack. Currently, I am working with PHP. 

Besides work, my mission in technology is bring uncomplicated and accessible content about development and computing in Brazilian portuguese, so anyone in my country can learn and improve their skills alongside me.

If you want to see more of what and how I code, I invite you to give a look in my pinned projects down bellow!
