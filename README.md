# Hi, I'm LÃ­via ðŸ¤“

I'm a software developer full-stack. 

If you are curious about how and what I code, feel free to checkout my pinned projects below or take a look at my [![resume](https://img.shields.io/badge/resume-7952B3)](./resume_liviarnascimento.pdf). Although I consider myself a technology agnostic â€“ if necessary, I'll find a way to code even in Assembly â€“, my long-term career goal is to become a Java development specialist.
