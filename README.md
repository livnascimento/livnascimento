# Hi, I'm LÃ­via ðŸ¤“

I'm a software developer focused on building multiplatform applications. Most of my experience is with Java and the Spring ecosystem, but I really enjoy exploring beyond a closed stack. Currently, I am working with PHP. 

Besides work, my mission in tech is create simple and accessible content about development and computing in Brazilian Portuguese, so anyone in my country can learn and improve their skills alongside me.

If you are curious about how and what I code, feel free to checkout my pinned projects below or take a look at my [![resume](https://img.shields.io/badge/resume-7952B3)](./resume_liviarnascimento.pdf).

That's all, folks. Hope to see you around!
